# hugo-mock-landing-page
This project is for CIS 3500 Spring 2024 Homework 1 Part IV.

In this assignment we cloned the [hugo-bootstrap-theme by Felipe Carneiro](url) before customizing the landing page to a product of our choice. We had to choose 6 features to highlight on the landing page, 3 of which were illustrated. These features were derived from user stories, which are also included in this repo.
