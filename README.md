# 🌐 hugo-mock-landing-page-domain-name

This project is for CIS 3500 Spring 2024 Homework 2 Part III.

In Homework 1, we cloned the [`hugo-bootstrap-theme` by Felipe Carneiro](url) before customizing the landing page to a product of our choice. We had to choose 6 features to highlight on the landing page, 3 of which were illustrated. These features were derived from user stories, which are also included in this repo.

## 🚀 Deployment

In this repo, we imported the `hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed` repo from Homework 2 Part II, and updated the `baseURL` in the `config.toml` file. We then configured the repository settings to allow the Workflow to have read and write permissions, ensure the publishing source is `gh-pages`, and allow all actions and reusable workflows.

Then, we bought a domain name on [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com). To match the name of my product, I bought [dailyxpert.co](https://dailyxpert.co/). 

We configured the domain name to point to our GitHub Pages website, before updating the 'gh-pages-deployment.yaml' workflow file in the '.github/workflows/' directory of this repo to have the cname set to our new domain name. Lastly, we updated the 'baseURL' in the 'config.toml' file to be the new URL of our custom domain ('https://dailyxpert.co/'), before verifying the website is deployed as expected.
